<h1>Warm Ups</h1>
<p>In order to make this goal specific, I may need to narrow down potential job opportunities. See what specific skills
    companies are looking for in their applicants. Then try to work on those skills to try to be ready. Also, may need
    to do research as to what skills are generally required for freelancing web dev jobs. I'll need to build some
    projects to gain some experience and develop relevant skills. Im hoping to get this accomplished within the next sic
    months.</p>
