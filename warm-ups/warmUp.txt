As of right now, I would like to get a web dev job in a financial institution such as a bank. Maybe being able to work on programs that the front line bank staff uses. But I also wouldn't mind taking up some freelancing web dev jobs. Would be great to land my first job in setting where I can continue to learn and gain experience. It would be nice to have a hybrid work setting between working in an office and being able to work remotely. I wouldn't mind staying near the Dallas area or moving to another city for a little while as I continue to gain experience.

Smart goal:
Specific, Measureable, Achieveable, Relevant, Time-Bound-

In order to make this goal specific, I may need to narrow down potential job opportunities. See what specific skills companies are looking for in their applicants. Then try to work on those skills to try to be ready. Also, may need to do research as to what skills are generally required for freelancing web dev jobs. I'll need to build some projects to gain some experience and develop relevant skills. Im hoping to get this accomplished within the next sic months.
